# Project Summary: Analyzing Global COVID-19 Data using SQL

In this project, I leveraged MS SQL Server to analyze global COVID-19 data, focusing on deaths and vaccination statistics. Key tasks included comprehensive data preparation, calculation of vital metrics, and employing advanced SQL techniques for data integration and analysis. The analysis encompassed several critical aspects:

1. **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths:** Comparing global COVID-19 cases with reported deaths to understand mortality rates.
2. **Countries with Highest Infection Rates:** Identifying nations with the most significant number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
3. **Countries with Maximum Death Count per Population:** Analyzing countries where COVID-19 deaths were most severe relative to their population size.
4. **Worldwide Total Cases & Deaths:** Aggregating and summarizing global COVID-19 statistics.
5. **Total Population vs. Vaccination Coverage:** Examining the relationship between total population and COVID-19 vaccination rates.
6. **Percentage of Population Vaccinated:** Calculating the percentage of people who received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine globally.
7. **Utilization of Temporary Tables:** Temporary tables efficiently perform complex calculations and partition data.
8. **Creation of Views for Visualization:** Developing views to store processed data for future visualization and reporting purposes.
   
Impact: This analysis provided crucial insights into COVID-19 infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination progress worldwide. By facilitating informed decision-making and targeted health interventions, the project contributed to managing the pandemic effectively on a global scale.
